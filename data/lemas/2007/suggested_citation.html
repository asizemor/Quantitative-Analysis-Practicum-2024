		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> Every three to four years, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) surveys a nationally
representative sample of state and local law enforcement agencies. The surveys
are conducted as part of the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) program. Data include agency
personnel, expenditures and pay, operations, community policing
initiatives, equipment, computers and information systems, and written
policies. The LEMAS survey has been conducted in 1987, 1990, 1993,
1997, 1999 (limited scope), 2000, 2003, and 2007.</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> Based on employment data from the
2004 BJS Census of State and Local Law
Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA), the
original 2007 LEMAS survey sample
included 3,224 state and local law enforcement
agencies. The sample was designed
to be representative of all general purpose
state and local law enforcement agencies
in the United States, with separate samples
drawn for local police departments and
sheriffs' offices. Agencies serving special
jurisdictions (such as schools, airports, or
parks) or with special enforcement
responsibilities (such hunting and fishing
laws or alcohol laws) were considered out
of scope for the survey.
Sheriffs' offices without primary law
enforcement jurisdiction were also considered
out of scope for the survey. In
addition, some smaller local police
departments were determined to have
closed since the 2004 CSLLEA and were
dropped from the sample. After all out-of-scope and closed agencies were
dropped, the final sample size for the
survey was 3,095.
The final sample included 950 self-representing
(SR) agencies with 100 or
more sworn personnel, and 2,145 nonself-representing (NSR) agencies
employing fewer than 100 sworn personnel.
The SR agencies included 591 local
police departments, 310 sheriffs' offices,
and 49 state law enforcement agencies.
All 950 SR agencies received the 49-item
CJ-44L questionnaire.
The NSR local police agencies were
selected using a stratified random sample
with cells based on the number of
sworn personnel. The NSR sheriffs'
offices were selected using a simple random
sample. Overall, the NSR sample
included 1,504 local police departments
and 641 sheriffs' offices. All 2,145 NSR
agencies received the 40-item CJ-44S
questionnaire.</span></p>

ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Created variable labels and/or value labels.</li><li>Standardized missing values.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
