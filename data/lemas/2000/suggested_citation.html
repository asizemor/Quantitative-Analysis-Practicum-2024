								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> For sampling purposes, the law enforcement agencies were
separated into two groups: self-representing (SR) and
non-self-representing (NSR) agencies. All state police or agencies
with 100 or more sworn full-time equivalent (FTE) employees are
SR. All remaining agencies in sheriff's department, local police, and
special police categories are NSR.For sampling purposes, the law enforcement agencies were separated into two groups: self-representing (SR) and non-self-representing (NSR) agencies.
