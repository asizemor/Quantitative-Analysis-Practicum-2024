# Quantitative Analysis Practicum

This course provides policy analysis PhD students with practical skills and tools to conduct quantitative analyses. Through this practicum, students will learn how to translate their knowledge on statistical theories and policy analysis tools into a completed applied analysis. By the course's completion, students should be able to:

1. Accurately plan out a research project step-by-step and execute it.
2. Use code to run a complete quantitative policy analysis, from formulazing research questions through visualizing model results.
3. Provide useful feedback to colleagues on code quality, analysis approaches, and presentation of results.
