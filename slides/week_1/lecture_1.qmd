## The purpose of this class

::: fragment
-   Most researchers learn to conduct quantitative analyses through apprenticeship.
:::

::: fragment
-   However, we can do better analyses if we follow a set of building blocks and interrogate our research designs.
:::

::: fragment
-   The purpose of this class is to learn skills to improve our analyses and to practice doing an analysis of our own.
:::

## Learning objectives

By the end of the quarter, you should be able to:

::: fragment
-   Evaluate the strength and weaknesses of a quantitative research design.
:::

::: fragment
-   Provide effective feedback and comments to other researchers on their research design.
:::

::: fragment
-   Implement a exploratory or causal analysis using R code.
:::

**Robustness:** \
Will my research design provide a reliable answer?

:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
::: fragment
**Feasability:** \
Is my research question answerable given my constraints?
:::
:::


::: {.column width="33%"}
::: fragment
**Relevancy:** \
Is this a meaningful question to ask and who is the audience?
:::
:::
:::

::: fragment
\
\
Relevancy is particularly important for policy analysis!
:::

## Robustness 

::: fragment
- An analysis is only useful if the results are reliable (unbiased and precise).
:::

::: fragment
- Our research design determines how much trust we can place in the estimates we develop.
:::

::: fragment
- To determine if our design is robust, we start with a theory of how the world is working.
:::

::: fragment
- For an exploratory analysis, we need to use theory to think critically about measurement. For a causal analysis, we also need to think about the research design.
:::

## Robustness - Generating a theory

Causal pathway diagrams allow us to visualize our theory and begin to develop a design plan.

## Robustness - Testing a theory

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
Using our theory, we can try to determine an accurate data strategy (measurement) and an answer strategy (design) to test our research question.

## Feasibility

::: fragment
-   Our research questions need to be scoped so we can answer them given available time and funding.
:::

::: fragment
-   To determine if our question is feasible, we need to use project management tools to evaluate if our time and resources will be enough to meet the needs of the project.
:::

::: fragment
-   Alternatively, we can scope our research question to fit our available resources
:::

## Feasibility - Plan out the steps

Try working back from then end of the study (the estimate) to the necessary methods and data needed to obtain that result.

## Feasibility - Plan out the steps

Flowcharts can be used to plan out analysis steps and also serve as a useful rhetorical tool.

## Feasibility - Planning out time

Gantt charts provide an intuitive way to plan out timing.

## Feasibility - Planning out budget

Use a a [budget estimator](https://randus.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/research/rfo/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BF2E4FDF3-5589-4165-8C5E-E18ABE5ABE98%7D&file=estimator-tool.xlsm&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1) adapted to your schedule and products.

## Feasibility - Scoping questions

::: fragment

*If you think about it, specificity is also an act of shrewdness. A survey of 40 years of literature is vulnerable to all kinds of objections*

*The subject of "Gealogy," for instance, is much too broad a topic. "Vulcanology" as a branch of geology, is still too comprehensive. "Volcanoes in Mexico" might be developed into a good but superficial paper. However, a further limitation to "The History of Popocateptl" (which one of Cortéz's conquistadores probably climbed in 1519 and which erupted violently as late as 1702) would make for a more valuable study. Another limited topic, spanning fewer years, would be "The Birth and Apparent Death of Paricutin"*

*Here, I would suggest the last topic, but only if the \[PhD\] candidate really says all there is to say about that damned volcano.*

:::

::: fragment
- Limit the geography or time-periods of the study.
:::

::: fragment
- Study less outcomes.
:::

::: fragment
- Use a simpler method.
:::

::: fragment
- Stratify fewer variables.
:::

## Relevancy - Generating questions

Figuring out impactful research questions seems to be an art; here's some starting points I've found useful:

::: fragment
- Be an informed citizen and policy observer.
:::

::: fragment
- Look out for methodological shortcomings in previous work.
:::

::: fragment
- Ask for feedback on ideas constantly [<span style="color:#fc8d62">(and not just from researchers)</span>]{.fragment}
:::


## Relevancy - Generating impact

Think critically about who will care about the results and how the results will be used:

::: fragment
- Who is the <span style="color:#fc8d62;">audience</span> for the study's results?
:::

::: fragment
- How will a <span style="color:#e78ac3;">decision-maker</span> use these results?
:::

::: fragment
- What are the <span style="color:#8da0cb;">policy-levers</span> available to the decision-maker?
:::

## Relevancy - Disseminating results

Your results are only useful if they get to the right audience. Start thinking about how your results will be disseminated at the beginning of your project!

::: fragment
- Start writing up your research article at the beginning. Good writing takes time.
:::

::: fragment
- Think through how you'll describe results if the study's hypothesis is confirmed. But also think through how the results will be useful if the hypothesis is rejected.
:::

::: fragment
- Set up multiple plans to disseminate results beyond a research article.
